INTERNSHIP & ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE
======
* Spring 2023: Graduation Design(Thesis): Research on Implementation of High-Order Correlation Power Analysis of AES Implementation with Combined Countermeasures
  * Tutor: Prof. Lu Jiqiang
  * Abstract: In this paper, we studied an AES implementation that combines countermeasures such as affine masking and shuffling. We reproduce the power consumption model and perform computational optimization to implement higher-order correlation power analysis in 12 different scenarios, and evaluate the results at a finer granularity. We also propose a method to calculate the effectiveness of the attack results.
