INTERNSHIP & ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE
======
* **Graduation Design(Thesis): Research on Implementation of High-Order Correlation Power Analysis of AES Implementation with Combined Countermeasures**
  * **Tutor:** Prof. Lu Jiqiang
  * **Abstract:** In this paper, we studied an AES implementation that combines countermeasures such as affine masking and shuffling. We reproduce the power consumption model and perform computational optimization to implement higher-order correlation power analysis in 12 different scenarios, and evaluate the results at a finer granularity. We also propose a method to calculate the effectiveness of the attack results.

* **Internship at Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace of Tsinghua University(2022.06-2022.08)**
  * **Tutor:** Associate Prof. Zhang Han
  * **Work during internship:** I read and studied more than 20 papers in top journals or conferences related to my major, and gave presentations about typical cases. The total code amount of the project is about 2000 lines, and the effective code amount of a single file can reach up to 600 lines.

* **Term Project of *Machine Learning*: Implementation of a Deep Learning Side-Channel Analysis Scheme for Boolean Masking Protected AES**
  *  **Tutor:** Associate Prof. Zhang Xiaoming
  *  **Abstract:** Conduct side-channel analysis using MLP and CNN models based on TensorFlow and scikit-learn frameworks on the ASCAD open-source dataset, and compare attack results under different leakage models.
  *  **Work during internship:** Experimental implementation and result analysis, as well as writing parts of the report.
