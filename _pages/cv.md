INTERNSHIP & ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE
======
* **Spring 2023: Graduation Design(Thesis): Research on Implementation of High-Order Correlation Power Analysis of AES Implementation with Combined Countermeasures**
  * **Tutor:** Prof. Lu Jiqiang
  * **Abstract:** In this paper, we studied an AES implementation that combines countermeasures such as affine masking and shuffling. We reproduce the power consumption model and perform computational optimization to implement higher-order correlation power analysis in 12 different scenarios, and evaluate the results at a finer granularity. We also propose a method to calculate the effectiveness of the attack results.

* **Summer 2022: Internship at Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace of Tsinghua University**
  * **Tutor:** Assistant Prof. Zhang Han
  * **Work during internship:** I read and studied more than 20 papers in top journals or conferences related to my major, and gave presentations about typical cases. The total code amount of the project is about 2000 lines, and the effective code amount of a single file can reach up to 600 lines.

* **Spring 2022: Term Project of *Network Security Innovative Experiment*: Security Vulnerability Exploitation and Defense for Small Networks**
  * **Tutor:** Prof. Mao Jian
  * **Responsibility:** I built Linux VMs and network environments, implemented specific attacks and defenses in them(buffer overflow, weak password cracking, network scanning, SQL injection, etc.).

* **Fall 2020: Term Project of *Digital Circuit and Systems*: FPGA-based SM4 algorithm implementation and optimization**
  * **Tutor:** Prof. Guan Zhenyu
  * **Responsibility:** Implementation(Verilog) and simulation(Modelsim) of SM4 cryptographic algorithm.
